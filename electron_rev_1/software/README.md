# Electron Sensor Board Rev 1
This sensor board is part of the [GridWatch](http://grid.watch) project.

The goal of this board is to test data collection in Accra. It contains 
an IMU with accel/mag and temp, two different microphones (one analog and
one digial), some memory, and a ultra-low power timer for future low-power 
optimizations. 

This directory will host development for all electron software and firmware.

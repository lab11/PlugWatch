# PlugWatch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lab11/PlugWatch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lab11/PlugWatch)

PlugWatch is part of the [GridWatch](http://grid.watch) project.

Unlike GridWatch, PlugWatch is not designed to run on everyday phones, rather it uses dedicated
smartphones as a sensor platform. PlugWatch is designed to be deployed as a semi-permanent installation,
with the phone constantly plugged into the power grid. PlugWatch also integrates with Bluetooth-enabled
commercial power meters, such as the [Wit Energy](http://www.wittech.net/WiTenergy.html), to collect
analytics such as line voltage not available to the phone alone.
